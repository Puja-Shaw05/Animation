        <h1><span>Cursor Click</span> Animation</h1>
        <p>Animation is the process of giving the illusion of movement to drawings, models, or inanimate objects. Animated motion pictures and television shows are highly popular forms of entertainment.An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another. You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want. To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation. Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.First and foremost, create an HTML button element to which you want to add the loading animation. Then, choose the CSS for the loading animation. Write CSS code to define the appearance of the animation: spinner, progress bar, or whatever your creativity and imagination are willing to create.
